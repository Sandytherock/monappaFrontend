          General Terms and Conditions of Monappa Publications
        </h1>

        <p>
          Thank you for visiting the Monappa Publications website! We’re
          thrilled to have you here, and by exploring or using our website (the
          "Website"), you’re agreeing to follow these General Terms and
          Conditions. These terms create a legal bond between you and Monappa
          Publications, guiding how you interact with our site, from browsing
          our book collection to making purchases. We’ve crafted them to be
          clear and fair, so please take a moment to read through. If anything
          doesn’t sit right with you, we respectfully ask that you step away
          from using the Website.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Diving into the Website means you’re on board with these terms,
          whether you’re flipping through pages, adding books to your cart, or
          just soaking in the info. We might tweak these terms now and then—life
          changes, and so do we—and those updates will kick in the moment they
          hit the Website. No heads-up is guaranteed, but if you keep using the
          site afterward, that’s your green light to the new version. Our goal
          with the Website is simple: to showcase our books, share details about
          what we offer, and let you bring some of our publications home. What
          you see—words, pictures, prices—is here for your personal enjoyment
          and info, and it might shift without a shout-out from us.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          We aim to keep things accurate and fresh, but we’re not perfect. The
          stuff on the Website—books, descriptions, you name it—comes without
          any big promises. We can’t vouch that it’s always spot-on,
          up-to-the-minute, or exactly what you’re looking for, so use it at
          your own pace and risk. Monappa Publications won’t be held responsible
          if something doesn’t work out as hoped, and it’s on you to make sure
          what you find fits your needs. We just ask that you play nice—keep
          your use legal and considerate, so everyone can enjoy the space.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          The Website is our creation, and what’s on it—think text, designs,
          logos, and layouts—belongs to us or our partners, locked down by
          copyright and trademark rules. Feel free to browse, but don’t borrow,
          share, or remix it without our written nod, unless our copyright note
          gives you the go-ahead. If you spot logos or marks that aren’t ours,
          they belong to their owners, and we’ll tip our hat to them. Trying to
          use our stuff without permission, especially for your own gain, could
          land you in trouble—think lawsuits or even legal penalties.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Shopping with us? We’ll need your details—think payment and delivery
          info—to get your books to you. Orders hinge on what’s in stock and our
          final say-so, and we can pull the plug if something’s fishy, like a
          typo in pricing or a whiff of fraud. Prices and stock can change on a
          dime, and our Shipping and Returns Policy (tied into these terms) has
          the full scoop on delivery and returns. You might spot links to other
          sites here—they’re handy shortcuts, but we don’t own or back them, so
          venture there at your own risk.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          We’ve got some house rules to keep things smooth. Don’t tamper with
          the Website—no hacking, viruses, or sneaky moves to mess with our
          setup. If we catch wind that you’re bending these terms or stirring
          trouble, we can cut off your access, no notice needed, and we won’t
          owe you for it. On that note, we’re not on the hook for any
          hiccups—big or small—that come from using the Website, like lost
          profits or data woes, even if we saw it coming. If your actions drag
          us into a mess, you’ll step up—covering us for any claims, costs, or
          headaches that pop up.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          These terms, paired with extras like our Privacy Policy or Shipping
          details, wrap up our deal with you. If one piece doesn’t hold water
          legally, the rest still stand tall. Skipping over a rule doesn’t mean
          we’re letting it slide forever—we’ll enforce what we need to.
