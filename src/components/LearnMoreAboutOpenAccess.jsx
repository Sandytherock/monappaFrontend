            At Monappa Publications, we’re dedicated to making knowledge
            accessible while empowering authors to share their work globally.
            Open access (OA) is one of the exciting options we provide to ensure
            your research or book chapter reaches readers worldwide without
            restrictions. Unlike our standard publication model, where chapters
            are included in books at no cost to the author but may require a
            purchase or subscription to access, open access makes your work
            freely available online from the day it’s published. This means
            anyone can read, download, and share your chapter, amplifying its
            reach and influence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our open access approach offers you choices. After you submit your
            manuscript and it’s accepted following review by our Publications
            Team, you’ll decide between standard publication or open access.
            Standard publication comes at no charge, placing your chapter in a
            traditionally published book. Choosing open access, however,
            involves a publication fee—often referred to as a Book Processing
            Charge (BPC) or Chapter Processing Charge (CPC)—to support
            production, peer review, and online hosting. These fees differ by
            book, so we recommend reviewing the guidelines for your selected
            title. For instance, a chapter in a category like Health and
            Medicine might have a unique fee compared to one in Education and
            Pedagogy, based on production needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            We understand that funding these fees might be a consideration, and
            we’re here to assist. While Monappa Publications doesn’t cover open
            access costs directly, many authors secure support from their
            institutions, research grants, or funding partners. As you browse
            our diverse subject categories—like Biological Sciences,
            Engineering, Sociology, or Arts and Media—you’ll find submission
            guidelines that list fees and suggest funding possibilities. We aim
            to keep everything clear and straightforward, helping you decide if
            open access, with its promise of broader readership, is the right
            fit for your work.

            Open access at Monappa Publications shines because of our varied
            catalog. Whether your chapter dives into emerging technologies or
            cultural histories, choosing open access ensures it’s not confined
            to subscription-only shelves—it’s available to students,
            professionals, and enthusiasts everywhere. Once your manuscript is
            approved and you sign a contract, our Publications Team will
            collaborate with you to finalize the format. Open access chapters
            are typically published under a Creative Commons license, giving you
            control over how others can use your work, such as requiring
            attribution or limiting commercial reuse. It’s about blending
            accessibility with your author rights.

            funding, or how open access aligns with your vision. At Monappa
            Publications, we’re committed to helping you share your chapter your
            way—whether through standard publication or the wide-open world of
            open access.
