          Privacy Policy of Monappa Publications
        </h1>

        <p>
          At Monappa Publications, we are committed to safeguarding your privacy
          and ensuring that your personal information is handled with care and
          respect. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose,
          and protect the information you provide while interacting with our
          website (the "Website"). By accessing or using the Website, you
          consent to the practices described herein. We encourage you to read
          this policy carefully to understand our approach to your personal data
          and to contact us if you have any questions or concerns.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          We may collect personal information from you when you engage with our
          Website, such as when you browse our catalog, make a purchase, sign up
          for our newsletter, or contact us for support. This information may
          include your name, email address, postal address, phone number,
          payment details, and any other details you voluntarily provide.
          Additionally, we may automatically collect certain technical data,
          such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, and browsing
          behavior, through the use of cookies and similar technologies. These
          tools help us enhance your experience, analyze Website usage, and
          ensure its proper functionality. You may adjust your browser settings
          to refuse cookies, though this could limit some features of the
          Website.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          The information we collect serves several purposes aimed at improving
          your experience with Monappa Publications. We use your personal data
          to process and fulfill your orders, including shipping books and
          notifying you of order updates. It also enables us to respond to your
          inquiries, provide customer support, and send you promotional
          materials or updates about our products and services if you have opted
          in to receive them. Technical data helps us monitor and improve the
          Website’s performance, troubleshoot issues, and tailor content to your
          preferences. We do not use your information for automated
          decision-making or profiling that significantly affects you without
          your explicit consent.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Protecting your personal information is a priority for Monappa
          Publications. We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and
          physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,
          alteration, or destruction of your data. For instance, payment
          transactions are processed through secure, encrypted channels provided
          by trusted third-party payment processors. However, no method of
          transmission over the internet or electronic storage is entirely
          infallible, and while we strive to protect your information, we cannot
          guarantee absolute security. You are encouraged to take your own
          precautions, such as using strong passwords and keeping them
          confidential.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third
          parties for marketing purposes. However, we may share your data with
          select third parties who assist us in operating the Website and
          delivering our services. These include shipping companies, payment
          processors, IT service providers, and marketing platforms (if you’ve
          subscribed to updates). Such third parties are contractually obligated
          to handle your information securely and only for the purposes we
          specify. In rare cases, we may disclose your data if required by law,
          such as to comply with a court order, or to protect the rights,
          property, or safety of Monappa Publications, our users, or the public.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          You have certain rights regarding your personal information. You may
          request access to the data we hold about you, ask for corrections if
          it’s inaccurate, or request its deletion, subject to any legal
          obligations we may have to retain it. If you’ve opted into marketing
          communications, you can unsubscribe at any time via the link in our
          emails or by contacting us directly. To exercise these rights or
          inquire about your data, please reach out to us at
          support@monappapublications.com. We will respond to your request
          promptly, typically within 30 days, unless additional time is needed
          due to complexity.

          Our Website may contain links to external sites operated by third
          parties. This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Monappa
          Publications Website and does not extend to those external sites,
          which have their own privacy practices. We encourage you to review the
          privacy policies of any linked websites you visit, as we are not
          responsible for their content or data-handling practices. Similarly,
          if you interact with us through social media platforms, those
          interactions are governed by the respective platform’s privacy
          policies.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes
          in our practices, technology, or legal requirements. Any updates will
          be posted on this page, and the revised policy will take effect
          immediately upon posting. We recommend checking this page periodically
          to stay informed. Your continued use of the Website after such changes
          signifies your acceptance of the updated policy. If we make
          significant changes affecting your rights, we will endeavor to notify
          you via email or a prominent notice on the Website.
